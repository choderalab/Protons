Protons is a python module that implements a constant-pH molecular dynamics scheme for sampling protonation states
and tautomers of amino acids and small molecules in OpenMM.
The codebase is currently under development by the `Chodera lab`_ at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center.
There is no official release of the code yet.

If you are interested in the development of this code, you can watch the `repository on Github`_.
For the planned features of the code, see :ref:`roadmap`.
